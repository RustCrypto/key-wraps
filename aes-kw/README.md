Pure Rust implementation of the [NIST AES-KW Key Wrapping Method] also
described in [RFC3394].

## About

RFC3394 ยง 2 describes AES-KW as follows:

> The AES key wrap algorithm is designed to wrap or encrypt key data.
> The key wrap operates on blocks of 64 bits.  Before being wrapped,
> the key data is parsed into n blocks of 64 bits.
> 
> The only restriction the key wrap algorithm places on n is that n be
> at least two.  (For key data with length less than or equal to 64
> bits, the constant field used in this specification and the key data
> form a single 128-bit codebook input making this key wrap
> unnecessary.)  The key wrap algorithm accommodates all supported AES
> key sizes.  However, other cryptographic values often need to be
> wrapped.  One such value is the seed of the random number generator
> for DSS.  This seed value requires n to be greater than four.
> Undoubtedly other values require this type of protection. Therefore,
> no upper bound is imposed on n.
> 
> The AES key wrap can be configured to use any of the three key sizes
> supported by the AES codebook.  The choice of a key size affects the
> overall security provided by the key wrap, but it does not alter the
> description of the key wrap algorithm.  Therefore, in the description
> that follows, the key wrap is described generically; no key size is
> specified for the KEK.

## Minimum Supported Rust Version

This crate requires **Rust 1.56** at a minimum.

We may change the MSRV in the future, but it will be accompanied by a minor
version bump.
